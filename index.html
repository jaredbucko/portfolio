    <p class="maintext">Welcome! Thank you for visiting my site. My journey to becoming a web developer has definitely been an interesting one. After graduating from UCLA in 2009 with a BA in Political Science, I wasn't sure what to do next. In a tight job market during the height of the Great Recession, I moved home to San Jose where I had accepted a part-time job as a PE and Music Teacher at a private elementary school. After a year in this position, I moved to Oregon to complete a MA in Teaching at George Fox University. From 2011 to 2016, I taught Social Studies at McMinnville High School in McMinnville, OR, and for the past several years I have worked part-time as a substitute teacher while pursuing other career and educational opportunities.</p>
    <p>After the birth of my son in March of 2019, I began to consider whether or not to return to teaching full-time. In the end, I decided instead to sign up for the Web Development boot camp through the University of Oregon, and I am so glad that I did! While I greatly value my 8 years as a teacher, I am ready for a new challenge and one that better taps into my love for technology and interest in solving complex problems while constantly learning new skills. I can't wait to continue building this site and sharing my talent as a developer.</p>

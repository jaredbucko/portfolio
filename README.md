# Developer Portfolio

## Jared Bucko

### **About this project**

As an aspiring web developer, it is crucial to be able to display my work publicly and establish a professional portfolio site. Currently, my site has three pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact; as of now, these pages are placeholders for future projects and the Contact page is not functional.

### **Future goals**

Next steps for this project will be to create a functioning contact page and to re-format the styling using Bootcamp to establish a more streamlined and functional layout for all device sizes.
